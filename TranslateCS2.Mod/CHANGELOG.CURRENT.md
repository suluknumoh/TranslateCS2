    - this mod checks the presence of a certain directory within the found mods
    - if a mod provides unoffical locales/translations, those translations are also taken into account
    - what does that mean?
        - if you use this mod pro-actively and provide a translation or translations as described within the readme
            - your provided translation(s) rule(s) and is/are not overwritten.
            - if a translation provided by another mod contains more/other/additional translations, those additional translations are also used in-game
